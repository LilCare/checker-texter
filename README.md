# checker-texter

## The app that lets teachers easily text parents as they check homework ##

> Teachers like to be able to easily communicate student progress with families.  This can mean a lot of time spent texting and calling, when they could be planning their next great lesson. This app uses React Native and the Twilio API to give teachers the opportunity to text some or all the families with the click of a button.
